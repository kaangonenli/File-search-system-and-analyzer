# Game Asset & Disk Usage Analyzer (CLI)

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.9%2B-blue) ![Libraries](https://img.shields.io/badge/Library-NumPy%20%7C%20Matplotlib-orange) ![Focus](https://img.shields.io/badge/Focus-Optimization%20%26%20Statistics-green)

A comprehensive CLI (Command Line Interface) tool designed for **Game Developers** and **DevOps Engineers** to analyze disk usage patterns, visualize file size distributions using statistical methods (PDF/CDF), and compare system states.

This tool goes beyond simple file listing; it uses **Probability Density Functions** to identify "storage bloat," analyzes asset distribution (textures, audio, models), and tracks changes between different game builds.

##  Key Features

* ** Recursive Scanning:** Efficiently crawls deep directory structures (`scanner.py`) to catalog metadata while handling permission errors gracefully.
* ** Statistical Analysis:** Calculates **PDF (Probability Density Function)** and **CDF** to detect file size anomalies and distribution patterns (`pdf_cdf.py`).
* ** Advanced Visualization:** Generates **Log-scale** and Linear histograms using **Matplotlib** to easily visualize data that spans from Kilobytes to Gigabytes (`plotter.py`).
* ** System Comparison (Diff Tool):** Compares two different scan snapshots (JSON) to highlight changes in file counts, sizes, and top extensions (`compare_systems.py`).
* ** JSON Export:** Exports detailed scan results and system metadata for external processing or archiving (`export_results.py`).
* ** Test Data Generator:** Includes a utility to generate randomized dummy file structures for testing algorithm efficiency (`create_test_folder.py`).

##  Project Structure

| File | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `main.py` | **Entry Point.** Orchestrates the scanning, analysis, and visualization pipeline. |
| `scanner.py` | Recursive directory crawler using `os.walk`. Handles file metadata extraction. |
| `pdf_cdf.py` | Statistical engine using **NumPy** to calculate distribution metrics. |
| `plotter.py` | Visualization engine using **Matplotlib** for generating analytical graphs. |
| `analyze.py` | Core logic for extension analysis, large file detection, and time-based distribution. |
| `compare_systems.py` | Logic to compare two exported JSON results (Build v1 vs v2). |
| `export_results.py` | Handles JSON serialization and captures system info (OS, Processor). |

##  Visuals & Output

*(Screenshots of the graphs generated by `plotter.py` should be placed here)*

### 1. File Size Distribution (PDF/CDF)
The tool plots the Probability Density Function to show where the majority of files sit in terms of size, and the Cumulative Distribution Function to answer questions like *"Do the largest 10% of files occupy 90% of the space?"*

##  Installation & Usage

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/Game-Asset-Analyzer.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/Game-Asset-Analyzer.git)
    cd Game-Asset-Analyzer
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install numpy matplotlib
    ```

3.  **Run the tool:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    *Follow the on-screen prompts. You can choose to scan a specific folder or generate a test folder.*

### Comparing Two Builds
To compare two different states (e.g., *Optimization_Pass_1* vs *Optimization_Pass_2*):

1. Run a scan and export results to `result_v1.json`.
2. Make changes to your files (or switch branches).
3. Run another scan and export to `result_v2.json`.
4. Use the comparison module:
    ```python
    from compare_systems import compare_two_systems
    compare_two_systems("result_v1.json", "result_v2.json")
    ```

## Use Cases
* **Game Optimization:** Identify which asset types (e.g., `.psd`, `.wav`, `.tiff`) are consuming the most build size.
* **Storage Forensics:** Find "heavy" outlier files that were accidentally committed to the repository.
* **CI/CD Pipeline:** Track build size growth over time by comparing JSON exports automatically.
